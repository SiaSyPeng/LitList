## Development notes
### Platform / Languages
This project will be developed in Java and Kotlin using Android studio. I prefer using Kotlin because it helps me make less null pointer exceptions, but feel free to use as much Java as you want. I will not be converting any Java to Kotlin and am comfortable using both languages. My only request is that all classes for holding JSON objects be defined as Kotlin data classes.

### Server protocol
As we develop the server, put all protocol here!
Let's use python to build our server. We need to get a Raspberry Pi from Sergey at some point.
